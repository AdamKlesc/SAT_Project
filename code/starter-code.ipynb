    "2. Visualize distributions using histograms. If you have a lot, consider writing a custom function and use subplots.\n",
    "    - *OPTIONAL*: Summarize the underlying distributions of your features (in words & statistics)\n",
    "         - Be thorough in your verbal description of these distributions.\n",
    "         - Be sure to back up these summaries with statistics.\n",
    "         - We generally assume that data we sample from a population will be normally distributed. Do we observe this trend? Explain your answers for each distribution and how you think this will affect estimates made from these data.\n",
    "3. Plot and interpret boxplots. \n",
    "    - Boxplots demonstrate central tendency and spread in variables. In a certain sense, these are somewhat redundant with histograms, but you may be better able to identify clear outliers or differences in IQR, etc.\n",
    "    - Multiple values can be plotted to a single boxplot as long as they are of the same relative scale (meaning they have similar min/max values).\n",
    "    - Each boxplot should:\n",

    "        - Have clear labels for each variable\n",
    "        - Have appropriate titles and labels\n",
    "4. Plot and interpret scatter plots to view relationships between features. Feel free to write a custom function, and subplot if you'd like. Functions save both time and space.\n",
    "    - Your plots should have:\n",
    "        - Two clearly labeled axes\n",
    "        - A proper title\n",
    "        - Colors and symbols that are clear and unmistakable\n",

    "From my analysis, I was able to conclude that the SAT has successfully managed to overtake the ACT once again as the market leader in standardized testing due to primarily to the SAT changes made to the format and structure. It not only made the test more appealing to students but also states themselves as number of them made it free during the time between 2019 from the date of the change. This is evidenced by the fact that the SAT once again, became the market-leader in standardized testing after the ACT's regression post-SAT change. While solving participation was a massive success in both participation numbers and time, the second problem is where the SAT still needs work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT change partially occurred due to the reputation that the SAT was a class-biased test, the strange scoring of the 2400 scale and detachment from the actual school work that students were learning in school lead to the ACT being more popular and while they did fix the problem with participation, the lingering problem of class-bias is still there. With more colleges pulling away from standardized testing and geographical location being so heavily tied to participation and success, there need to be more upcoming changes to rectify this issue and make the SAT a more equitable test."
